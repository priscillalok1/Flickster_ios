## Notes

The two biggest challenges were implementing the search bar and implementing a gradient view for the bottom of each cell.  The search bar was difficult to implement since there were lots of variables to take into account with the filtered data.  The gradient view was difficult to implement since I did not quite understand the concept of CGRect, and at first needing to specify an end and start coordinate to the gradient since sample code I found online did not specify this.
